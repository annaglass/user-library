# user-library

CS 1 - Library User Interface Project

- First project in starting computing class, created a library and book objects and functions provided an interface for retrieving certain info from the library (including book recommendations, creating a discussion group, adding and update ratings for books)
- Learned about private and public aspects of a class (getter and setter functions)
- Reading a file using getline and split, ASCII table values and use
- Arrays of objects, retrieving specific info using function parameters
- Figuring out where helper functions were necessary to keep functions concise and have a single use (this was mind blowing for me)
